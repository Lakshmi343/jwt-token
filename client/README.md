Encryption is a two-way function; what is encrypted can be decrypted with the proper key. Hashing is the process of converting a given key into another value. A hash function is used to generate the new value according to a mathematical algorithm.





In typical password storage mechanisms, the process is designed to be one-way, meaning you don't decrypt a stored password. Instead, you hash the password and store the hash. During authentication, you compare the hash of the entered password with the stored hash.

Node.js commonly uses libraries like bcrypt for password hashing. With bcrypt, you don't decrypt the stored hash; rather, you hash the entered password and compare it to the stored hash.

Here's an example of how you would typically use bcrypt for hashing and verifying passwords:
